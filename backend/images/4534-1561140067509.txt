citi interview feedback

positives
	v good work experience

negatives
	cv needs edited, different fonts? caps, bold
		take out dob, ni number etc
		reorder qualifications to grade DESC
	
	lacked ethical and analytical skills
		prepare better for those questions
		ethical will come up with bigger employers
		working with diverse cultures, backgrounds etc
	
group - probably the highest scoring interview for me
	did contribute good responses and was listened to etc
